@phdthesis{Adams.2014,
 abstract = {The goal of this dissertation is to investigate systematic variation in English comparative adjective formation using the insights of lexical prosody and Optimality Theory. I provide a sustained argument in favor of lexically specified, representationally rich prosodic structure. Chapter 1 introduces comparative adjective variation (CAVE) in the context of morphological-periphrastic alternations in language and draws particular attention to comparative grammaticality as a theoretically appropriate solution to the systematic nature of CAVE. Chapter 2 provides an in-depth corpus analysis of spoken and written English from the Corpus of Contemporary American English. Alongside replicating several earlier results, the chapter provides evidence for the variable, systematic nature of suffixation to adjectives of different prosodic and morphological shapes. In Chapter 3, I make two major claims. First, I argue that morphemes can exhibit various degrees of prosodic strength, spelled out as differences in structure, an inherent property of morphemes as they are stored as Roots in an abstract lexicon. Second, I argue that token frequency influences prosodic strength through the direct modulation of prosodic structure; infrequent and phonotactically complex short adjectives are less likely to undergo reduction processes because of their more articulated prosodic structure. In contrast, frequently used adjectives have less articulated prosodic structure, which results in more reduction processes. These two claims set the basis for a representational difference between high- and low-frequency adjectives, which accounts for their divergent susceptibility to phonological reduction and phonetic shortening. Chapter 4 is concerned with spelling out the structure of the grammar of comparative suffixation. It divides the grammar into Stem and Word strata and argues that variable suffixation rates require both stratal and representational (morphological and prosodic) routes of explanation. In sum, variable suffixation results from the representational differences argued for in Chapter 3, as well as the dual-stratum membership of -er at the Stem and Word strata. A variety of adjective types are considered. Chapter 5 addresses comparative grammaticality at the level of syntax and sketches a preliminary analysis of how phrasal prosody may also affect suffixation rates, which has implications for the phonology-syntax interface and the degree to which lexical and syntactic information should be separated in linguistic theory. Chapter 6 concludes the dissertation, comparing present contributions to previous work on CAVE.},

@book{Aronoff.1976,
 abstract = {In spite of the wide-spread recognition that morphology has a place in generative grammar, Aronoff's book is one of the few proposals of a theory of morphology within that framework, and is certainly the most extensive. Much of the book centers around traditional observations concerning morphology, particularly those of the American structuralists, and how they are to be handled and/or explained within a generative account. In fact, in some respects Aronoff's model appears to re-adopt earlier, pre-generative views; e.g., his proposed class of allomorphy rules (see below) is reminiscent of what were called morphophonemic rules in an earlier tradition. However, in important respects that will be pointed out below, Aronoff's claims represent a departure from traditional assumptions as well as from earlier generative accounts. -- from http://www.jstor.org (Feb. 7, 2014).},

@article{Babyak.2004,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Statistical models, such as linear or logistic regression or survival analysis, are frequently used as a means to answer scientific questions in psychosomatic research. Many who use these techniques, however, apparently fail to appreciate fully the problem of overfitting, ie, capitalizing on the idiosyncrasies of the sample at hand. Overfitted models will fail to replicate in future samples, thus creating considerable uncertainty about the scientific merit of the finding. The present article is a nontechnical discussion of the concept of overfitting and is intended to be accessible to readers with varying levels of statistical expertise. The notion of overfitting is presented in terms of asking too much from the available data. Given a certain number of observations in a data set, there is an upper limit to the complexity of the model that can be derived with any acceptable degree of uncertainty. Complexity arises as a function of the number of degrees of freedom expended (the number of predictors including complex terms such as interactions and nonlinear terms) against the same data set during any stage of the data analysis. Theoretical and empirical evidence--with a special focus on the results of computer simulation studies--is presented to demonstrate the practical consequences of overfitting with respect to scientific inference. Three common practices--automated variable selection, pretesting of candidate predictors, and dichotomization of continuous variables--are shown to pose a considerable risk for spurious findings in models. The dilemma between overfitting and exploring candidate confounders is also discussed. Alternative means of guarding against overfitting are discussed, including variable aggregation and the fixing of coefficients a priori. Techniques that account and correct for complexity, including shrinkage and penalization, also are introduced.},

@article{Barth.2014,
 abstract = {The present paper presents a multimodel inference approach to linguistic variation, expanding on prior work by Kuperman and Bresnan (2012). We argue that corpus data often present the analyst with high model selection uncertainty. This uncertainty is inevitable given that language is highly redundant: every feature is predictable from multiple other features. However, uncertainty involved in model selection is ignored by the standard method of selecting the single best model and inferring the effects of the predictors under the assumption that the best model is true. Multimodel inference avoids committing to a single model. Rather, we make predictions based on the entire set of plausible models, with contributions of models weighted by the models' predictive value. We argue that multimodel inference is superior to model selection for both the I-Language goal of inferring the mental grammars that generated the corpus, and the E-Language goal of predicting characteristics of future speech samples from the community represented by the corpus. Applying multimodel inference to the classic problem of English auxiliary contraction, we show that the choice between multimodel inference and model selection matters in practice: the best model may contain predictors that are not significant when the full set of plausible models is considered, and may omit predictors that are significant considering the full set of models. We also contribute to the study of English auxiliary contraction. We document the effects of priming, contextual predictability, and specific syntactic constructions and provide evidence against effects of phonological context.},

It also offers analyses of the theoretical challenges these phenomena present. It is the first to make systematic use of large linguistic corpora, including the Corpus of Contemporary American English, the British National Corpus, and the American National Corpus by which, for example, the authors are able to measure the productivity of different patterns and to trace semantic developments as they happen. After setting out their methodology and theoretical assumptions, the authors describe word formation and inflection in contemporary English. They give equal weight to form and meaning and cover nominalizations, agentive forms, comparatives, root and synthetic compounds, as well as more recondite topics such as the abstract noun-forming suffixes -hood, -dom, and -ship, neoclassical compounds, and the morphology of numbers. They examine the relations between orthography and phonological form. While their focus is on contemporary morphology, they trace the history of phenomena wherever doing so helps to understand and explain current form and function. The final part of the book shows how the data assembled within it bear on current theoretical issues and reveal new lines of research. This outstanding book will interest all scholars and students of English and of linguistic morphology more generally.},

This paper addresses the problem of morpho-phonological variability and the role of phonetic detail in morphologically complex words by investigating the gemination behavior of the English prefixes un- and in-. Traditionally, it is assumed that un- geminates while in- degeminates, but empirical studies are rare and not conclusive. This paper presents the first study that uses data from natural speech (Switchboard Corpus, Godfrey and Holliman 1997). It is shown that both prefixes geminate, contra large parts of the literature. Furthermore, there is a difference in nasal duration between un-, negative in- and locative in-. The more segmentable the prefix the longer the nasal duration. The results challenge widely-shared assumptions in morphological theory, lexical phonology and models of speech production, and support models in which the strength of morphological boundaries may impact on the durational properties of complex words.},

 abstract = {The paper presents evidence for the influence of word frequency and prosodic structure on the edge marking strength in German binary compounds. Recent studies from a usage-based background have shown that high word frequency enhances articulatory reductions. Accordingly, high frequency compounds are expected to have a less strongly marked internal prosodic boundary. The edge marking phenomena under investigation are glottal stop deletion or reduction, and the deletion or reduction of geminates across the boundary of two adjacent prosodic words. A production study was carried out, and the data were analyzed acoustically. The results indicate that high word frequency leads to significantly more deletions and stronger reductions across the boundary of the phonological word. Gradient reductions are observed as well as categorical deletions.},

Seven native speakers of Hebrew read matched sentence pairs in which bisyllabic key words appeared in non-final and sentence-final position. Final fricatives showed almost four times as much utterance-final lengthening as the preceding stressed vowel. Final lengthening affected the duration of each segment of the final syllable, and also extended to the initial unstressed syllable of the final word. Though final fricatives showed more lengthening in sentence-final position than final-stop closures, no difference was found in the lengthening of the vowels preceding these consonants. The greater lengthening of the final fricative relative to the preceding vowel resulted in C/V ratios which failed to distinguish between the voiceless fricative in non-final position and the voiced fricative in utterance-final position. These results suggest that sentence position is taken into account in the perception of voicing, such that the C/V ratio applicable in non-final position is increased by a factor of two in final position.},

We report 4 experiments investigating this issue using forced-choice identification and mouse-tracking tasks. We find that listeners are in fact able to distinguish mono- and multimorphemic words using only subphonemic information. Our experiments reveal that duration information alone is sufficient to make this discrimination and that listeners make use of an abstract rule that relates duration to morphological structure. The implications of these results for theories of morphological processing are discussed.},

@phdthesis{Brewer.2008,
 abstract = {A large domain of linguistic inquiry concerns the nature of words.  It is widely thought that words are stored and represented in our minds in a structure termed the lexicon, in which every word has a 'lexical representation'.  Researchers conduct experiments and examine intuitions about words to determine the content and structure of the lexicon.  One interesting component in lexical representation, for literate speakers, is an orthographic representation for words.  It has been traditionally assumed that while this orthographic information is available and useful in such tasks as visual word recognition (i.e. reading) or in writing, orthographic information about words is not necessarily involved in non-visual linguistic tasks, like auditory word perception, or speech production.There has been some research however, which has challenged this notion of the isolation of orthographic information to visual processes.  In a seminal study Seidenberg and Tanenhaus (1979) found an influence of orthography in an auditory rhyming judgment task.  Subjects were faster to judge as rhyming those pairs which shared an orthographic representation of the rhyme than those who shared only phonology (i.e. pie-tie vs. rye-tie).  Additional recent research has confirmed these effects of orthography in auditory perception tasks (Taft {\&} Hambly, 1985; Halle, Chereau, {\&} Sequi, 2000; Ziegler {\&} Ferrand, 1998).  Even more surprisingly, some experiments have suggested effects of orthography in speech production (Tanenhaus, Finigan {\&} Seidenberg, 1980; Lupker, 1982; Wheeldon {\&} Monsell, 1992; Damion {\&} Bowers, 2003).  These experiments all show facilitated naming latencies for words which share orthographic characteristics with some prime environment.  As such, these results can all be explained as effects of orthography on lexical access of words rather than affecting the production process per se.In contrast, the experiments and analyses described in this dissertation show an un-ambiguous effect of orthography on speech production.  Orthographic characteristics of word-final sounds, and words themselves are shown to influence the durations of spoken productions of those sounds, and whole words.  These effects are robust to the mode of lexical access, whether through experimentally elicited reading aloud of words, or through the spontaneous generation of words in a modified sociolinguistic interview format.},

Three production experiments investigated the roles of the relative frequencies of the two pronunciation variants of French words with schwa: the schwa variant (e.g., ) and the reduced variant (e.g., ). In two naming tasks and in a symbol--word association learning task, variants with higher relative frequencies were produced faster. This suggests that the production lexicon keeps a frequency count for each variant and hence that schwa words are represented in the production lexicon with two different lexemes. In addition, the advantage for schwa variants over reduced variants in the naming tasks but not in the learning task and the absence of a variant relative frequency effect for schwa variants produced in isolation support the hypothesis that context affects the variants' lexical activation and modulates the effect of variant relative frequency},

In order to determine which of the many variables mentioned in the literature influence variant choice, 17 predictors were tested in the same analysis. Only five of these variables appeared to condition variant choice. The question of the processing stage, or locus, of this alternation process is also addressed in a comparison of the variables that predict variant choice with the variables that predict the acoustic duration of schwa in variants with schwa. Only two variables predicting variant choice also predict schwa duration. The limited overlap between the predictors for variant choice and for schwa duration, combined with the nature of these variables, suggest that the variants without schwa do not result from a phonetic process of reduction; that is, they are not the endpoint of gradient schwa shortening. Rather, these variants are generated early in the production process, either during phonological encoding or word-form retrieval. These results, based on naturally produced speech, provide a useful complement to on-line production experiments using artificial speech tasks.},

In perception, it is widely believed that both whole-word and root representations exist, while in production there is little evidence for whole-word representations. The present investigation demonstrates that whole-word and root frequency independently predict the duration of words suffixed with -ing, -ed, and -s, which reveals that both root and word representations play a role in the production of inflected English words. In a second line of analysis, we find that the number of inflected phonological neighbours independently predicts the duration of monomorphemic words, which extends these results and suggests that whole-word representations exist at the lexical level. Together these results suggest that both root and word representations of inflected words are stored in the lexicon and are relevant for the production of both monomorphemic and multimorphemic words.},

 abstract = {This paper examines the effects of morpheme boundaries on intergestural tim-ing, and demonstrates that low-level phonetic realization is influenced by morpho-logical structure, i.e. compounding and affixation. It reports two experiments, one using electromagnetic midsagittal articulography (EMA) and one electropalatography (EPG), examining Korean data. The results of the EMA study show that intergestural timing is less variable for adjacent gestures across the word boundary inside a lexi-calized compound than inside a nonlexicalized compound, and inside a monomor-phemic word than across a morpheme boundary. The EPG study (which examined the timing in palatalization of a coronal) shows that both [ti] and [ni] have more vari-ability in gestural timing when heteromorphemic than when tautomorphemic. Fur-thermore, the phonetic details of gestural overlap shed light on the asymmetry on palatalization between tautomorphemic and heteromorphemic gestural sequences (e.g. ni vs. n-i ), presumably driven by paradigmatic contrast and preference of over-lap. In short, what emerges from two experiments is that gestures are coordinated more stably within a single lexical item (a morpheme or a lexicalized compound) than across a boundary between lexical items. In accounting for the stability of interges-tural timing within a lexical entry, several hypotheses were discussed including the Phase Window, Bonding Strength, Phonological Timing and Extended Phase Window model newly proposed here. The implication is that the morphological structure may be encoded in the phonetic realization, as is the case with other linguistic structure (e.g. prosodic structure).},

 abstract = {Following much work in linguistic theory, it is hypothesized that the language faculty has a modular structure and consists of two basic components, a lexicon of (structured) entries and a computational system of combinatorial operations to form larger linguistic expressions from lexical entries. This target article provides evidence for the dual nature of the language faculty by describing recent results of a multidisciplinary investigation of German inflection. We have examined: (1) its linguistic representation, focussing on noun plurals and verb inflection (participles), (2) processes involved in the way adults produce and comprehend inflected words, (3) brain potentials generated during the processing of inflected words, and (4) the way children acquire and use inflection. It will be shown that the evidence from all these sources converges and supports the distinction between lexical entries and combinatorial operations. Our experimental results indicate that adults have access to two distinct processing routes, one accessing (irregularly) inflected entries from the mental lexicon and another involving morphological decomposition of (regularly) inflected words into stem + affix representations. These two processing routes correspond to the dual structure of the linguistic system. Results from event-related potentials confirm this linguistic distinction at the level of brain structures. In children's language, we have also found these two processes to be clearly dissociated; regular and irregular inflection are used under different circumstances, and the constraints under which children apply them are identical to those of the adult linguistic system. Our findings will be explained in terms of a linguistic model that maintains the distinction between the lexicon and the computational system but replaces the traditional view of the lexicon as a simple list of idiosyncrasies with the notion of internally structured lexical representations},

Overwhelmingly, this research has found that higher contextual probability leads to phonetic reduction. Less attention, however, has been given to paradigmatic probability, or the probability of using a particular linguistic form from a paradigm of related forms. The research that has addressed this type of probability has found inconsistent results: Sometimes higher paradigmatic probability leads to phonetic enhancement, and sometimes to phonetic reduction. In this paper I present the results of an experiment exploring the effects of both types of probability simultaneously on the pronunciation of agreement suffixes on English verbs. I find that (i) singular verb suffixes and stems are phonetically reduced when singular agreement is contextually probable; (ii) the nature of the reduction is modulated by verb frequency, consistent with dual-route models of lexical retrieval; and (iii) suffixes are phonetically enhanced when they are paradigmatically probable. I conclude by discussing how the patterns observed in this study shed light on the previous contradictory findings regarding the effects of paradigmatic probability on pronunciation},

This paper reviews what is known about how multimorphemic words are represented in production at lexical and post-lexical stages as well as the influence that lexical properties have on post-lexical processes. A proposal linking these facts together is presented which predicts that post-lexical processes (1) should be weaker when acting across morpheme bundaries and (2) should be influenced by the lexical properties of each morpheme. Post-lexical processing is thus predicted to vary, or be ``heterogeneous'', across a multimorphemic word. Phoneme competition (as indexed by inhibitory effects of phoneme similarity) is compared within and across morphemes in three analyses of oral reading latencies. Competition is found to be weaker across morpheme boundaries, providing support for heterogeneity.},

 abstract = {Morphological and phonological processes are tightly interrelated in spoken production. During processing, morphological processes must combine the phonological content of individual morphemes to produce a phonological representation that is suitable for driving phonological processing. Further, morpheme assembly frequently causes changes in a word's phonological well-formedness that must be addressed by the phonology. We report the case of an aphasic individual (WRG) who exhibits an impairment at the morpho-phonological interface. WRG was tested on his ability to produce phonologically complex sequences (specifically, coda clusters of varying sonority) in heteromorphemic and tautomorphemic environments. WRG made phonological errors that reduced coda sonority complexity in multimorphemic words (e.g., passed$\rightarrow$[p{\ae}st{\i}d]) but not in monomorphemic words (e.g., past). WRG also made similar insertion errors to repair stress clash in multimorphemic environments, confirming his sensitivity to cross-morpheme well-formedness. We propose that this pattern of performance is the result of an intact phonological grammar acting over the phonological content of morphemic representations that were weakly joined because of brain damage. WRG may constitute the first case of a morpho-phonological impairment-these results suggest that the processes that combine morphemes constitute a crucial component of morpho-phonological processing.},

 abstract = {Phonological theories differ as to whether phonological knowledge is abstract (e.g., phonemic), concrete (e.g., exemplar-based), or some combination of the two. The abstractness/concreteness of phonological knowledge was examined by analyzing the process of /r/-sandhi in two corpora of spoken English. Two predictions of exemplar-based theories were examined: the extent to which a word manifests a particular sound pattern like /r/-deletion should be influenced by (1) its lexical frequency and (2) its distribution in the language with respect to the sound pattern's conditioning environment. Lexical frequency was found to influence /r/-sandhi in a corpus of rhotic American English but not in a corpus of predominantly non-rhotic British English. No effect of a word's long-term distribution was found in either corpus. These results support theories proposing that phonological knowledge is both word-specific and abstract and indicate that speakers do not store all phonetic detail that is in principle available to them. The factors that may favor the use of word-specific versus abstract representations are discussed.},

Kiparsky's opponents point out the existence of exceptions to such relative prominence preservation, e.g. `{\i}nf´erior $\rightarrow$ `{\i}nf˘eri´ority$\sim$˘{\i}nf`eri´ority. In this article, it is shown that relative prominence preservation is a gradient phenomenon, which is probabilistically predicted by word frequency. This observation necessitates the rejection of the phonological cycle as the mechanism for handling relative prominence preservation -- the phonological cycle predicts that relative prominence preservation should be consistently successful. In particular, it is proposed, following Berm´udez-Otero {\&} McMahon (2006) and Berm´udez-Otero (in preparation), that the phonological cycle which applies internal to stratum one in models of Lexical Phonology should be rejected, and replaced by the mechanism of `fake cyclicity'. Through its resemblance to the dual-route model of lexical access, fake cyclicity can capture the probabilistic nature of relative prominence preservation.},

 abstract = {Arabic dialects are characterized by the occurrence of geminate consonants in word-medial and word-final position. This article relates the patterning of Arabic geminates to the on-going controversy in phonological theory concerning the representation of geminate consonants. Two views are contrasted: the prosodic length analysis of geminates whereby a geminate is underlyingly a single consonant phoneme linked to two C-slots, and the moraic weight representation where a geminate is underlyingly a single consonant linked to a mora. We specifically argue that the patterning of geminate consonants in Arabic dialects largely supports the moraic weight representation. Evidence comes from phenomena such as the patterning of word-final geminates, the behavior of geminates with respect to stress, geminates in loanwords, and geminates in first language acquisition. We show that each of these phenomena supports the moraic weight representation of geminates.},

Participants recognized neologisms more quickly if they had seen them before in the experiment. These results show that memory traces for novel morphologically complex words already come into existence after a very first exposure and that they last for at least a week.

Interestingly, Base Frequency appeared to play a role in the processing of the neologisms also when they were presented a second time and had their own memory traces.},

Word initial gemination in Maltese occurs through a morphological process in both Semitic and non-Semitic verbs. Surface geminates arise through the assimilation of the definite article before coronal sounds (il ! it in it-tama). In these surface geminates a bona fide vowel always precedes. In terms of duration, the singleton to geminate ratio is 1:1.6. Surface geminates are on average 7ms shorter than lexical geminates. Lexical geminates are consistently preceded by a vocalic element, also of an /ɪ/ quality, when the preceding word ends in a consonant.  When the preceding word ends in a vowel, this vocalic element was also found (contrary to predictions from Maltese grammars), but is subject to within and across speaker variation.},

I present results from a homophone production experiment suggesting that (i) morphologically conditioned vowel lengthening is a real eﬀect, (ii) contrary to previous reports, morphologically conditioned vowel shortening exists, and (iii) morphologically conditioned lengthening may be stronger for nonce words than for real words, across both vowel and consonant contexts. I conclude by arguing that the evidence actually favors the coexistence of both the phonetic implemen-tation and the lexical access accounts.},

Despite the theoretical importance of the wordform lexicon, the exact localization and function of the lexicon in the broader context of language use is not well understood. This review draws on evidence from aphasia, functional imaging, neuroanatomy, laboratory phonology and behavioral results to argue for the existence of parallel lexica that facilitate different processes in the dorsal and ventral speech pathways. The dorsal lexicon, localized in the inferior parietal region including the supramarginal gyrus, serves as an interface between phonetic and articulatory representations. The ventral lexicon, localized in the posterior superior temporal sulcus and middle temporal gyrus, serves as an interface between phonetic and semantic representations. In addition to their interface roles, the two lexica contribute to the robustness of speech processing.},

One contribution examines the phonological word in a sign language. The theoretical issues dealt with in the book include: evidence for the phonological word (e.g. rules, phonotactics, syllabification, stress patterns), the connection between morphosyntactic and prosodic structure (e.g. alignment phenomena in Optimality Theory), and the relationship between the phonological word and other prosodic constituents (e.g. the prosodic representation of clitics).

 abstract = {This paper investigates the nature of reduction phenomena in informal speech. It addresses the question whether reduction processes that affect many word types, but only if they occur in connected informal speech, may be categorical in nature. The focus is on reduction of schwa in the prefixes and on word-final /t/ in Dutch past participles. More than 2000 tokens of past participles from the Ernestus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch and the Spoken Dutch Corpus (both from the interview and read speech component) were transcribed automatically. The results demonstrate that the presence and duration of /t/ are affected by approximately the same phonetic variables, indicating that the absence of /t/ is the extreme result of shortening, and thus results from a gradient reduction process. Also for schwa, the data show that mainly phonetic variables influence its reduction but its presence is affected by different and more variables than its duration, which suggests that the absence of schwa may result from gradient as well as categorical processes. These conclusions are supported by the distributions of the segments{\&}apos; durations. These findings provide evidence that reduction phenomena which affect many words in informal conversations may also result from categorical reduction processes.},

 abstract = {ABSTRACT: This paper examines the role of morphological structure in the reduced pronunciation of morphologically complex words by discussing and re-analyzing data from the literature. Acoustic reduction refers to the phenomenon that, in spontaneous speech, phonemes may be shorter or absent. We review studies investigating effects of the repetition of a morpheme, of whether a segment plays a crucial role in the identification of its morpheme, and of a word's morphological decomposability. We conclude that these studies report either no effects of morphological structure or effects that are open to alternative interpretations. Our analysis also reveals the need for a uniform definition of morphological decomposability. Furthermore, we examine whether the reduction of segments in morphologically complex words correlates with these segments' contribution to the identification of the whole word, and discuss previous studies and new analyses supporting this hypothesis. We conclude that the data show no convincing evidence that morphological structure conditions reduction, which contrasts with the expectations of several models of speech production and of morphological processing (e.g., WEAVER++ and dual-route models). The data collected so far support psycholinguistic models which assume that all morphologically complex words are processed as complete units.},

A vigorous ongoing debate surrounds the question of how such internal structure is best accounted for: by means of lexical entries and deterministic symbolic rules, or by means of probabilistic subsymbolic networks implicitly encoding structural similarities in connection weights. In this review, we separate the question of subsymbolic versus symbolic implementation from the question of deterministic versus probabilistic structure. We outline a growing body of evidence, mostly external to the above debate, indicating that morphological structure is indeed intrinsically graded. By allowing probability into the grammar, progress can be made towards solving some long-standing puzzles in morphological theory.},

@article{Keine.2012,
 abstract = {There is considerable disagreement between theories of morphology concerning the complexity attached to words consisting of more than one morpheme. While, e.g., Distributed Morphology views complex words as a hierarchical structure of individual pieces associated with morpho-syntactic features, inferential frameworks such as A-Morphous Morphology and Paradigm Function Morphology treat complex words as morphologically simplex, consisting merely of a phonological string without any morphological constituent structure. Based on evidence from the Bolivian language Baure this paper argues that the restrictiveness of the latter view prevents an elegant analysis of certain syncretism patterns. The pervasive property of the Baure paradigm is that all agreement markers may appear in word-initial and work-final positions. This pattern can only be directly expressed in the analysis if complex words actually have more than just phonological structure. The argument thus challenges rule-based frameworks of morphology.

Highlights► In Baure the phonological content of agreement markers is conditioned by ϕ-features. ► The linear position of these markers is conditioned by the grammatical function of the agreement controller. ► An exponent's phonological makeup has to be severed from its status as a prefix/suffix. ► Only framework that grant morphologically complex words hierarchical structure allow this severance. ► The argument challenges familiar claims in rule-based theories that complex words have only phonological structure.},

 abstract = {It has recently been shown that listeners use systematic differences in vowel length and intonation to resolve ambiguities between onset-matched simple words (Davis, Marslen-Wilson, {\&} Gaskell, 2002; Salverda, Dahan, {\&} McQueen, 2003). The present study shows that listeners also use prosodic information in the speech signal to optimize morphological processing. The precise acoustic realization of the stem provides crucial information to the listener about the morphological context in which the stem appears and attenuates the competition between stored inflectional variants. We argue that listeners are able to make use of prosodic information, even though the speech signal is highly variable within and between speakers, by virtue of the relative invariance of the duration of the onset. This provides listeners with a baseline against which the durational cues in a vowel and a coda can be evaluated. Furthermore, our experiments provide evidence for item-specific prosodic effects.},

@article{Kotzor.2016,
 abstract = {In languages with an underlying consonantal length contrast, the most salient acoustic cue differentiating singletons and geminates is duration of closure. When concatenation of identical phonemes through affixation or compounding produces  fake geminates, these may or may not be realized phonetically as true geminates. English and German no longer have a productive length contrast in consonants, but do allow sequences of identical consonants in certain morphological contexts, e.g., suffixation (green-ness; zahl-los {\dq}countless{\dq}) or compounding (pine nut; Schul-leiter {\dq}headmaster{\dq}). The question is whether such concatenated sequences are produced as geminates and realized acoustically with longer closure duration, and whether this holds in both languages. This issue is investigated here by analyzing the acoustics of native speakers reading suffixed and compound words containing both fake geminate and non-geminate consonants in similar phonological environments. Results indicate that the closure duration is consistently nearly twice as long for fake geminates across conditions. In addition, voice onset time is proportionally longer for fake geminates in English while vowel duration shows few significant differences (in German sonorants only). These results suggest that English and German speakers articulate fake geminates with acoustic characteristics similar to those found in languages with an underlying length contrast, despite no longer displaying the contrast morpheme-internally.},

Using production and perception data on initial, medial and final stops in Thurgovian, a dialect spoken in north-eastern Switzerland, we show that the pattern of phrase-medial contrast neutralisation supports both arguments: when the extra phonological length position of a geminate is not syllabifiable, the closure duration shortens and underlying geminates and singletons become indistinguishable. The perception data in particular make evident that closure duration is the crucial cue of the underlying contrast, because, in the absence of this phonetic correlate, listeners can no longer discriminate an underlying geminate from a singleton. The results bear not only on central issues concerning the representation of geminates but also on some intricacies of the phonology-phonetics interface.},

The volume brings together original data and novel analyses of geminate consonants in a variety of languages across the world. Experts in the field present a wide range of approaches to the study of phonological contrasts in general by introducing various experimental and non-experimental methodologies; they also discuss phonological contrasts in a wider context and examine the behaviour of geminate consonants in loanword phonology and language acquisition. The volume takes an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on experimental phonetics, theoretical phonology, speech processing, neurolinguistics, and language acquisition.},

 abstract = {Research on spoken word production has been approached from two angles. In one research tradition, the analysis of spontaneous or induced speech errors led to models that can account for speech error distributions. In another tradition, the measurement of picture naming latencies led to chronometric models accounting for distributions of reaction times in word production. Both kinds of models are, however, dealing with the same underlying processes: (1) the speaker's selection of a word that is semantically and syntactically appropriate; (2) the retrieval of the word's phonological properties; (3) the rapid syllabification of the word in context; and (4) the preparation of the corresponding articulatory gestures. Models of both traditions explain these processes in terms of activation spreading through a localist, symbolic network. By and large, they share the main levels of representation: conceptual/semantic, syntactic, phonological and phonetic. They differ in various details, such as the amount of cascading and feedback in the network. These research traditions have begun to merge in recent years, leading to highly constructive experimentation. Currently, they are like two similar knives honing each other. A single pair of scissors is in the making.},

 abstract = {Preparing words in speech production is normally a fast and accurate process. We generate them two or three per second in fluent conversation; and overtly naming a clear picture of an object can easily be initiated within 600 msec after picture onset. The underlying process, however, is exceedingly complex. The theory reviewed in this target article analyzes this process as staged and feed-forward. After a first stage of conceptual preparation, word generation proceeds through lexical selection, morphological and phonological encoding, phonetic encoding, and articulation itself. In addition, the speaker exerts some degree of output control, by monitoring of self-produced internal and overt speech. The core of the theory, ranging from lexical selection to the initiation of phonetic encoding, is captured in a computational model, called WEAVER++. Both the theory and the computational model have been developed in interaction with reaction time experiments, particularly in picture naming or related word production paradigms, with the aim of accounting for the real-time processing in normal word production. A comprehensive review of theory, model, and experiments is presented. The model can handle some of the main observations in the domain of speech errors (the major empirical domain for most other theories of lexical access), and the theory opens new ways of approaching the cerebral organization of speech production by way of high-temporal-resolution imaging.},

@article{Marcus.1995,
 abstract = {Language is often explained as the product of generative rules and a memorized lexicon. For example, most English verbs take a regular past tense suffix (ask-asked), which is applied to new verbs (faxed, wugged), suggesting the mental rule {\dq}add - ed to a Verb.{\dq} Irregular verbs (break-broke, go-went) would be listed in memory. Alternatively, a pattern associator memory (such as a connectionist network) might record all past tense forms and generalize to new ones by similarity; irregular and regular patterns would differ only because of their different numbers of verbs. We present evidence that mental rules are indispensible. A rule concatenates a suffix to a symbol for verbs, so it does not require access to memorized verbs on their sound patterns, but applies as the {\dq}default,{\dq} whenever memory access fails. We find 21 such circumstances for regular past tense formation, including novel, unusual-sounding, and rootless and headless derived words; in every case, people inflect them regularly (explaining quirks like flied out, sabre-tooths, walk-mans). Contrary to the connectionist account, these effects are not due to regular words constituting a large majority of vocabulary. The German participle -t applies to a much smaller percentage of verbs than its English counterpart, and the German plural -s applies to a small minority of nouns. But the affixes behave in the language like their English counterparts, as defaults. We corroborate this effect in two experiments eliciting ratings of participle and plural forms of novel German words. Thus default suffixation is not due to numerous regular words reinforcing a pattern in associative memory. Because default cases do not occupy a cohesive similarity space, but do correspond to the range of a symbol, they are evidence for a memory-independent, symbol-concatenating mental operation.},

Prosodic Phonology also includes a chapter in which experimental psycholinguistic data support the proposed hierarchy.A perceptual study provides evidence that prosodic constituent structure - not syntactic constituent structure - predicts whether listeners are able to disambiguate different types of ambiguous sentences. A chapter on the phonology of poetic meter examines portions of Dante's Divine Comedy.It is demonstrated that the constituents proposed for spoken language also make interesting predictions about literary metrical patterns.

Prosodic Phonology is an important reference not only for phonologists, but for all linguists interested in the issue of interfaces among the components of grammar.It is also a basic resource for psycholinguists and cognitive scientists working on linguistic perception and language acquisition.},

 abstract = {The current study focused on the production of non-contrastive geminates across different boundary types in English to investigate the hypothesis that word-internal heteromorphemic geminates may differ from those that arise across a word boundary. In this study, word-internal geminates arising from affixation, and described as either assimilated or concatenated, were matched to heteromorphemic geminates arising from sequences of identical consonants that spanned a word boundary and to word-internal singletons. Word-internal geminates were found to be longer than matched singletons in absolute and relative terms. By contrast, heteromorphemic geminates that occurred at word boundaries were only longer than matched singletons in absolute terms. In addition, heteromorphemic geminates in two word phrases were typically 5{\dq}pulled apart5{\dq} in careful speech; that is, speakers marked the boundaries between free morphemes with pitch changes and pauses. Morpheme boundaries in words with bound affixes were very rarely highlighted in this way. These results are taken to indicate that most word-internal heteromorphemic geminates are represented as a single long consonant in the speech plan rather than as a consonant sequence. Only those geminates that arise in two word phrases exhibit phonetic characteristics that are fully consistent with the representation of two identical consonants crossing a morpheme boundary.},

 abstract = {Oh, Eunhae. 2013. Effects of boundary strength on geminate duration in English. Studies in Phonetics, Phonology and Morphology 19.3. 457-478. Payne (2005) argues that fake geminates are longer than true geminates and Ridouane (2007) shows that their preceding vowel duration is also significantly longer. These effects are likely due to the boundary that distinguishes fake from true geminates. If this is correct, boundary strength is expected to affect fake geminates with different morpheme boundaries. In Experiment 1, we investigated this possibility by comparing the absolute and consonant-to-vowel durations of assimilated (Level 1) and concatenated (Level 2) word-internal and cross-word boundary fake geminates in English (e.g., immoral vs. unnamed vs. fun name). The results showed that both types of concatenated fake geminates were shorter than assimilated fake geminates in relative terms. A follow up experiment, comparing geminates in compound words to those emerging across words showed no differences in relative duration between the two. These results suggest that boundary strength may be less important than boundary decomposability in production. Overall, we argue that boundary decomposability impacts the phonetic implementation of geminates and likely does so whether these are true or fake. (Hyupsung University)},

In both accented and unaccented words, the position of primary and secondary stress significantly influences F0, intensity, and spectral balance. The effects are, however, much weaker for unaccented words. A model is presented which can, for accented words, very successfully distinguish the two stress patterns on the basis of pitch, intensity, duration, spectral balance in the two stressed syllables and the pitch slope in the left position. In contrast, the stress patterns of unaccented words cannot be successfully detected on the basis of the acoustic parameters. The findings strongly support an accent-based phonological account of the primary--secondary stress distinction. Primary and secondary stress syllables are not different from each other, unless the word is pitch-accented. In this case what is usually labeled the primary stress syllable becomes the target of a nuclear accent. Left-prominent accented words receive one accent, right-prominent accented words two accents.

Highlights► Primary and secondary stress significantly influence F0, intensity, and spectral balance. ► A model is proposed that can distinguish the two stress patterns in accented words. ► Primary and secondary stress do not differ substantially in unaccented words. ► Results speak for an accent-based account of the primary-secondary stress distinction.},

 abstract = {This study investigated the role of morphological structure in explaining pro-nunciation variation. The focus was on the Dutch derivational sufﬁx -igheid (/´xhEit/), which occurs in two types of words. In the ﬁrst type, -igheid is ana-lyzed as a single sufﬁx. In the second type, there is a morphological boundary between -ig and -heid.The main research question was whether this difference is reﬂected in the duration of the /xh/ cluster. Two hypotheses were distinguished: one based on prosodic structure, which predicts that the cluster is shorter in the ﬁrst type than in the second type, and one based on the informativeness of the afﬁx given the morphological paradigm, which makes the opposite predic-tion. All occurrences of -igheid in a corpus of read speech were acoustically analyzed using Automatic Speech Recognition technology. The duration of the /xh/ cluster was found to be shorter in words of the second type than in words of the ﬁrst type, providing support for the hypothesis based on informativeness. This ﬁnding suggests that morphological effects on ﬁne phonetic detail cannot always be explained by prosodic structure.},

@article{Prasada.1993,
 abstract = {Both regular inflectional patterns (walk-walked) and irregular ones (swing-swung) can be applied productively to novel words (e.g. wug-wugged; spling -splung). Theories of generative phonology attribute both generalisations to rules; connectionist theories attribute both to analogies in a pattern associator network; hybrid theories attribute regular (fully predictable default) generalisations to a rule and irregular generalisations to a rote memory with pattern-associator properties. In three experiments and three simulations, we observe the process of generalising morphological patterns in humans and two-layer connectionist networks. Replicating Bybee and Moder (1983), we find that people's willingness to generalise from existing irregular verbs to novel ones depends on the global similarity between them (e.g. spling is readily inflectable as splung, but nist is not inflectable as nust). In contrast, generalisability of the regular suffix does not appear to depend on similarity to existing regular verbs Regularly suffixed versions of both common-sounding plip and odd-sounding ploamph were reliably produced and highly rated, and the odd-sounding verbs were not rated as having worse past-tense forms, relative to the naturalness of their stems, than common-sounding ones. In contrast, Rumelhart and McClelland's connectionist past-tense model was found to vary strongly in its tendency to supply both irregular and regular inflections to these novel items as a function of their similarity to forms it was trained on, and for the dissimilar forms, successful regular inflection rarely occurred. We suggest that rule-only theories have trouble explaining patterns of irregular generalisations, whereas single-network theories have trouble explaining regular ones; the computational demands of the two kinds of verbs are different, so a modular system is optimal for handling both simultaneously. Evidence from linguistics and psycholinguistics independently calls for such a hybrid, where irregular pain are stored in a memory system that superimposes phonological forms, fostering generalisation by analogy, and regulars are generated by a default suffix concatenation process capable of operating on any verb, regardless of its sound.},

This study exam-ines the way these autosegmental representations are reﬂected in the phonetic details of speech production and questions their phonological relevance. In particular, it investigates two questions: what are the acoustic and articulatory differences between singletons and lexical geminates? Are there any acoustic differences between lexical, assimilated and concatenated geminates? Tashlhiyt Berber serves as a test case for these issues. This language has contrastive sin-gleton and lexical geminate consonants in various word positions, and presents two types of phonologically derived geminates: concatenated and assimilated ones. Results from two production studies show that: (1) the primary corre-late that distinguishes singletons from lexical geminates is duration, even for voiceless stops after pause, and (2) the three types of geminates all show the same temporal characteristics, but they differ on additional phonetic properties. While assimilated geminates, like underlying ones, are enhanced by additional acoustic attributes, concatenated geminates are not. Implications of these re-sults for the general issue of geminate behavior are discussed, with particular attention to ambiguity and inalterability effects},

 abstract = {Most English prefixes are syllables that can also begin words in which they do not function as a productive prefix. The literature notes a pronunciation difference such that true-prefixes, e.g. /dɪs/ in discolour, have a heavier rhythmic beat than pseudo-prefixes, e.g. /dɪs/ in discover. When the syllable following dis- or mis- begins with a voiceless stop, there is a clear difference in its VOT, but differences in dis/mis itself are more subtle and have not been systematically measured. Five speakers of Southern British English engaged in 40 scripted dialogues which contained such words in controlled phonetic contexts. Prefixed words were longer up to voicing onset in syllable 2 and had longer and more peripheral [ɪ], longer VOT, and shorter [s] than pseudo-prefixed words. These differences produced distinctive acoustic patterns consistent with the difference in perceived beat. Effects due to nuclear/postnuclear accent and word frequency were observed, but appear to be secondary to effects of morphological status. We conclude that the morphological status of these syllables is the primary cause of their characteristic acoustic patterns, and that their segmental composition dictates further reduction processes they may undergo due to weaker prosodic contexts, higher word frequency, casual register, and other influences.

Highlights► Phonetic detail of English dis mis prefixes differs from initial non-prefix dis mis. ► Differences support claims of stronger beat and syllable boundary for prefixes. ► Morphological status is the primary cause of their distinctive acoustic patterns. ► Weaker prosodic contexts and higher word frequency may cause further reduction. ► Such multiple influences may enhance or blur the basic morphological contrast.},

 abstract = {Moraic theory standardly syllabifies geminates in a coda-onset configuration whereby the coda bears a mora. Initial geminates pose a serious problem for the theory since word-initially no coda exists to host the first half of the geminate. Previous proposals have addressed this issue but have not resolved it satisfactorily, because they have created new difficulties pertaining to prosodification, syllabification or generation of insufficient or incorrect patterns. I propose that treating the geminate as a moraic onset simultaneously resolves all the issues above, provided we dispense with the stipulation that onsets are never moraic. An important prediction emerges from this proposal: onset geminates could also occur wordmedially. I claim that such prediction is empirically confirmed in languages like Marshallese and Trique. I also argue that moraic theory is right in claiming that geminates are underlyingly moraic consonants - rather than simply long - and demonstrate how in the current model the contrast between geminates and singletons is preserved in all positions in the word.},

 abstract = {The present study shows that [t] consonants are affected by probabilistic factors in a syllable-timed language as French, and in spontaneous as well as in journalistic speech. Study 1 showed a word bigram frequency effect in spontaneous French, but its exact nature depended on the corpus on which the probabilistic measures were based. Study 2 investigated journalistic speech and showed an effect of the joint frequency of the test word and its following word. We discuss the possibility that these probabilistic effects are due to the speaker's planning of upcoming words, and to the speaker's adaptation to the listener's needs.},

 abstract = {The morphological constituents of English compounds (e.g., {\dq}butter{\dq} and {\dq}fly{\dq} for {\dq}butterfly{\dq}) and two-character Chinese compounds may differ in meaning from the whole word. Subjective differences and ambiguity of transparency make judgments difficult, and a computational alternative based on a general model might be a way to average across subjective differences. In the present study, we propose two approaches based on latent semantic analysis (Landauer {\&} Dumais in Psychological Review 104:211-240, 1997): Model 1 compares the semantic similarity between a compound word and each of its constituents, and Model 2 derives the dominant meaning of a constituent from a clustering analysis of morphological family members (e.g., {\dq}butterfingers{\dq} or {\dq}buttermilk{\dq} for {\dq}butter{\dq}). The proposed models successfully predicted participants' transparency ratings, and we recommend that experimenters use Model 1 for English compounds and Model 2 for Chinese compounds, on the basis of differences in raters' morphological processing in the different writing systems. The dominance of lexical meaning, semantic transparency, and the average similarity between all pairs within a morphological family are provided, and practical applications for future studies are discussed.},

 abstract = {Psycholinguists are making increasing use of regression analyses and mixed-effects modeling. In an attempt to deal with concerns about collinearity, a number of researchers orthogonalize predictor variables by residualizing (i.e., by regressing one predictor onto another, and using the residuals as a stand-in for the original predictor). In the current study, the effects of residualizing predictor variables are demonstrated and discussed using ordinary least-squares regression and mixed-effects models. Some of these effects are almost certainly not what the researcher intended and are probably highly undesirable. Most importantly, what residualizing does not do is change the result for the residualized variable, which many researchers probably will find surprising. Further, some analyses with residualized variables cannot be meaningfully interpreted. Hence, residualizing is not a useful remedy for collinearity.},

@article{YungSong.2013,
 abstract = {In the process of phonological development, fricatives are generally assumed to be later acquired than stops. However, most of the observational work on which this claim is based has concerned itself with word-initial onset consonants; little is known about how and when fricatives are mastered in word-final coda position (e.g., nose). This is all the more critical in a language like English, where word-final fricatives often carry important morphological information (e.g., toes, goes). This study examines the development of duration cues to the voicing feature contrast in coda fricatives, using longitudinal spontaneous speech data from CVC words (e.g., noise vs face) produced by three children (1;6--2;6 years) and six mothers. Results show that the children were remarkably adult-like in the use of duration cues to voicing contrasts in fricatives even in this early age range. Furthermore the children, like the mothers, had longer frication noise durations for morphemic compared to non-morphemic fricatives (e.g., toes vs nose) when these segments occurred in utterance-final position. These results suggest that although children's fricatives tend to be overall longer and more voiced compared to those of adults, the voicing and morphological contrasts for fricative codas are acquired early in production.},
